# Programming for Social Science, Fall 2022

## Goal

By the end of the course, students can write small programs (less than hundred lines) which help them to collect, process and analyze data through computational means. There are three sub goals for this course

1. developing skills in _computational thinking_, here understood as the process where real-world problem is presented as coding problems
   
2. introducing students to programming language and developing elementary skills for them to help implement computational thinking to some of the real world problems
   
3. discuss and deepen the applications of computational social science in practical research, that is existing literature and different applications they have in social science and developing sociological imagination

!!! info 
    **This is an hands on-course.** The course focuses on building programming skills. Students are expected to work on programming exercises. The workload of this course can be heavy. 


The course provides hands-on skills for applied computational social science approaches. Course examines:

- variables
- control structures
-  file input and output 
-  lists and dictionaries as data structures
-  functions
-  using external libraries

## Course practicalities

We use **flipped classroom approach** in this course. That means we expect students to familiarize with the course material on their own before lectures. These pre-assignments follow the materials regarding Python or R. 

The course assignments are scheduled evenly for each week. You are able to complete the course at your own pace independently as long as you submit your work by the weekly deadlines.

### Sessions

Session take place every Tuesday at 10:15-11:45 at Unioninkatu 35, lecture hall 114 starting November 1st. Participation to the session is not mandatory.

Our empahsis in the class is to work on assigned programming exercises. Joni will be there to help you, but for most parts this will be independed work. During the session, we focus on that week's exercises, but you can also ask help for previous exercises.

### Assignments 

We expect you to return some of your assignments every week to Moodle by the following Monday 11.59 AM. The returned exercises are marked in each exercise sheets. 

### Evaluation

The course is graded on pass/fail -scale. This aims to motivate everyone to take the course, as it will not impact your grade point average.

Passing grade on this course requires 80% of exercises done for all exercises.

### Course Material

All course material (incl. assignments) will be available in Moodle area.
